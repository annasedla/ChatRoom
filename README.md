# ChatRoom

Basic chat web application hosted on Heroku that uses Node.js and Socket.IO. Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web application. It enables real time communication between the web client and server. The web app will support unlimited number of users to access the chat. To further extend the functionality, the application will support nicknames, based on what is the userâ€™s IP. It will also notify all users when somebody connects/disconnects. 

The app is now live via Heroku at https://awesomechatforever.herokuapp.com/.
